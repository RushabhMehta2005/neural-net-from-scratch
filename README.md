# NeuralNetPy

NeuralNetPy is a minimal neural network library built from scratch in Python. Ideal for learning basic neural network operations like forward propagation, backpropagation, and simple gradient descent optimization.

## Features

- Feedforward neural networks with customizable layers and activations
- Supports tanh, sigmoid and relu activation functions
- Basic training and evaluation metrics (MSE)

## Results
- Solved binary XOR operator in 10000 epochs
